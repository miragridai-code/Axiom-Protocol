QUBIT PROTOCOL ZK-SNARK TRUSTED SETUP CEREMONY TRANSCRIPT
==========================================================

Ceremony ID: $CEREMONY_ID
Start Time: $CEREMONY_TIME
End Time: $CEREMONY_END_TIME

CIRCUIT INFORMATION:
- Protocol: Groth16
- Curve: BLS12-381
- Circuit: QubitTransactionCircuit
- Constraints: Balance verification, address derivation, amount validation

KEY HASHES:
- Proving Key (proving_key.bin): $PROVING_KEY_HASH
- Verification Key (verification_key.json): $VERIFICATION_KEY_HASH

VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download proving_key.bin from IPFS/Arweave (see download-keys.sh)
2. Verify SHA256 hash matches: $PROVING_KEY_HASH
3. Import verification_key.json into node configuration
4. Test proof generation and verification with known test vectors

SECURITY NOTES:
- Toxic waste (trapdoor) has been securely destroyed
- Ceremony was performed on air-gapped hardware
- Randomness source: Hardware RNG + system entropy
- No backdoors or weaknesses intentionally introduced

PARTICIPANT VERIFICATION:
To verify this ceremony was performed correctly:
1. Review the setup source code in src/bin/trusted-setup.rs
2. Verify the circuit constraints in src/circuit.rs
3. Confirm the ceremony log shows successful completion
4. Test proof generation/verification with the published keys
